            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>For me, patience is looking for progress, not perfection. Perfection is like a 
                    horizon, as we chase after it, we may seem going closer to it but never reach it. 
                    At some point, we may get disappointed for not reaching that horizon. Similarly, 
                    if we look for perfection in our work, we may get disappointed at some point.</p>
                <p>Perfection has infinite levels. Letâ€™s assume at time t1, X is at level-1 and Y is 
                    at level-2, both chasing perfection. Level-2 is the pseudo-point of perfection from 
                    the perspective of X and Level-3 is the pseudo-point of perfection from the perspective
                    of Y. At time t2, X reaches Level-2 in the chase for perfection but as X reaches there 
                    pseudo-point of perfection have been shifted to Level-3 and it keeps on shifting ahead 
                    as X moves forward. The story of Y is also similar.</p>
                <p>In this never-ending chase for perfection what we can do for better results and 
                    satisfaction is to look for progress. We should see those pseudo-points of 
                    perfection as points of progress. We should be grateful for how far we have 
                    reached rather than chasing perfection. The most important thing is we should 
                    measure our tasks in order to make faster progress.</p>
                <p>So again the same question, do you have patience? If we are desperate to become 
                    perfect then we have no patience and if we focus on progress then yes we have patience.</p>
